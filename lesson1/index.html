    The Simpsons is an American animated television sitcom starring the animated Simpson family, which was created by
    Matt Groening. He conceived of the characters in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office and named them after his own
    family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name.

    Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the spouse
    of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy,
    and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love,
    and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main
    protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.
